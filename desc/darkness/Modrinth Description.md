## **Description:**

Moody brightness not dark enough? Do you want moonless nights and unlit caverns to be pitch black? This mod is for you!

In addition to maintaining the mod for newer versions, this fork also fixes compatibility issues with [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons) and adds some server-side functionality, such as config syncing.

## **FAQ:**

*Question: Does this mod work with shaders?*
- Answer: No it doesn't. This mod achieves the darkening by modifying the vanilla lightmap, which shaders typically disregard entirely. If you are looking for a similar experience with shaders, ComplementaryShaders happens to include options to make caves completely dark as well as having moon-phases affect lighting.

*Question: Does this mod need to be on the server too?*
- Answer: Nope. The visual effects of this mod is entirely client-side. However, installing it on the server will unlock additional functionality like config synchronization.
